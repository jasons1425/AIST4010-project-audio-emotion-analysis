- Refer to the folder `baseline` for the spectrogram learning approach

- Refer to the folder `PANN` for the waveform learning approach

- Refer to the folder `data_preparation` for the notebooks used for generating audio waveform and spectrograms

- **Folders `old_spec_approach` and `models` contains the source codes used in the earlier stage, and no longer applicable in the final report**

- Thank you :)
